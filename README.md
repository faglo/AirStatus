# **AirStatus for Linux**
#### Check your AirPods battery level on Linux

### What is it?
This is a Python 3.6 script, forked from [faglo/AirStatus](https://github.com/faglo/AirStatus) that allows you to check AirPods battery level from your terminal, as JSON output.

### Usage

```
python3 main.py [output_file]
```

Output will be stored in `output_file` if specified.

This script requires `bleak` package. Install it with: `pip3 install bleak`.

#### Example output

```
{"status": 1, "charge": {"left": 95, "right": 95, "case": -1}, "charging_left": false, "charging_right": false, "charging_case": false, "model": "AirPodsPro", "date": "2021-12-22 11:09:05"}
```
